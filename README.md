# Javascript-Game-Prototype-for-The-Finnish-Kidney-and-Liver-Association

The prototype of a Javascript game project programmed by me for The Finnish Kidney and Liver Association.

This game part of my thesis, which is a teamwork project. My role in this project is to do most of the programming, and to guide the development process.

This prototype is created entirely with native JavaScript. I created it using object oriented programming. The game is intended for high school students,
and is educational. The finished game will have a comprehensive story, and will have lots of educational content about healthy life choices such as 
avoidance of drugs and alcohol, and the importance of good eating habits. The finished game will be set in a fantasy setting.

The images for this prototype are created with Stable Diffusion AI image generator.
